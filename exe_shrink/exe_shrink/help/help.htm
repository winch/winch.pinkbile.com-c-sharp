<div>Exe shrinker is a runtime style system for darkbasic pro exes. Dlls are not stored in the exe but instead sourced from an external location.<br />
This allows many exes to share the same dlls freeing up disk space.<br />
Optionally md5 checksums can be used to ensure the sourced dlls are the same as the ones the
exe was originally compiled with.<br />
When the exe runs it first looks for dlls in the exe directory then if dbpro is installed
it checks in the dbpro compiler directory.</div>

Start exe shrink and load a dbpro exe by clicking the Load button.<br />
Internal files are those that will be inculded in the shrunk exe.<br />
External files are those that will be sourced from the dbpro install dir when the shrunk exe is run.<br /><br />
The program will attempt to guess which files should go where but will occasionally get it wrong.<br />
You can move files by right clicking on them and selecting Move to Internal/External.

<div>Next decide if you want to include checksums for external files.<br />
If selected a md5 checksum of the file will be inculded in the shrunk exe. When this exe is run<br />
it will check the files it sources from the dbpro install dir match the md5 checksum.<br />
If the checksums do not match the user will be asked if they want to continue running the exe.<br />

Load the shrunk exe in dark explorer and select tools -&gt; Decompress Exe. Dark explorer will then<br />
decompress the exe using the same method it uses to decompress exes compiled with the compress media option.
