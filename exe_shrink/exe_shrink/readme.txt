Description
+++++++++++

Exe shrinker is a runtime style system for darkbasic pro exes.<br />
Dlls are not stored in the exe but instead sourced from an external location.<br />
This allows many exes to share the same dlls freeing up disk space.<br />
Optionally md5 checksums can be used to ensure the sourced dlls are the same as the ones the
exe was originally compiled with.
When the exe runs it first looks for dlls in the exe directory then if dbpro is installed
it checks in the dbpro compiler directory.

See help/help.htm for instructions.
