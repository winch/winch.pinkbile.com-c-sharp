To compile your own expander you need codeblocks from http://www.codeblocks.org/
Optionally you can compress the dll with upx from http://upx.sourceforge.net/

After you compile run shrink.bat which will attempt to compress the dll with upx then
rename it to compress.dat.


Once you have a compress.dat stick it in the same directory as shrinker.exe
