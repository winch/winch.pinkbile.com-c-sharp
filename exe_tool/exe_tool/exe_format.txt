Dbpro exes appear to be standard exes with files appended on the end.

Attached files start emidiatly after "PADDINGXXPAD" section
Find "PADDINGXXPAD" then keep reading until you read a byte not in "PADDINGXXPAD"
The file up until the end of "PADDINGXXPAD" section is represented by "Standard Exe Header"
If "PADDINGXXPAD" is not found I assume the appeded files start at byte 73,728.

A more complicated but reliable way is to find the end of the exe and start reading from there.
There are several descriptions of the pe format on wotsit.org that can be used to find the end of
the exe where the attached files start.

The attached files are in the format

int namelength
name
int filelength
filedata

Included media files have a "media\" prefix to the filename.

if the name length is long (>50) or 0 then I assume it isn't a file but a compressed block or the extra few bytes
that are allways at the end of a dbpro exe. This is represented in the program by "Extra or Compressed block"
A compressed block is the compressed data that is produced when you compile the exe with the "compress attached media"
option.

_virtual.dat format
