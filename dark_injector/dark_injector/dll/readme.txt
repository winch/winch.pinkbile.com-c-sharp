To add your own dlls.

Create a subdirectory and name it with the name you want to appear in the dll listbox.
Within that subdirectory place your compress.dll

Optionally you can also include a description in a desc.txt file. The contents of this
text file will appear next to the dll listbox when your dll is selected.

For programming details see the example dll source in the src\dll directory.
