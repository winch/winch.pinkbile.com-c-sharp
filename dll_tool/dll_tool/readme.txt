usage
+++++

Documentation is also provided in the doc subdirectory.
Start the program and load a .net dll. The dll will then be run through ildasm to get the .il code for the dll. The il
code will be displayed in the listbox at the bottom of the screen.
Any methods in the dll will be displayed in the left hand list box. Select and methods you want to export and press
the ">" button to move them into the exports listview box. You can double click on an item in the export box to edit the export name and calling convention.
To add a string table check "Add string table" then use "Add" button to add strings or generate button to automatically
generate a dbpro string table.
Click the save .dsf button if you want to save the exports and string table in a .dsf file. Then when you modify your .net
dll you can just load the .dsf file instead of moving all the methods and editing the string table.
Then click the build button and select where to save the new dll. The modified il code will then be run through ilasm to
produce a new dll. You can use this dll in dbpro using the CALL DLL commands or as a TPC if you included a string table.
